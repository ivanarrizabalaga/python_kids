**Whats this?**

Just a uber minimalistic repo where I add a python script from time to time to play around code with my 11 year old kid

**Can I use it?**

I doubt you can find anything useful around here but for sure.

**Setup**

 1. Create a separated venv so you can play around with your dependencies

    `python -m venv .venv --prompt="python-kids"`

 2. Install your dependencies into that env

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 3. Run any given script like this

    `python madlib.py`
